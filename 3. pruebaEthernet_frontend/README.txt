ERROR: getToken() = null

got the same problem, getToken() returns NULL,
had the problem with existing google-services.json in /platforms/android/
ive deleted the file, re-added the plugin with cordova
-> the platforms/android/google-services.json was a 0-size file

but the problem is it does not work either. file exists, no luck, what now ?
